# Tasks
Implement the following search algorithms for solving different mazes:

1. Breadth-first search (BFS)
2. Depth-first search (DFS)
3. Iterative deepening search (IDS)
4. Greedy best-first search (GBFS)
5. A* search

Run each of the above algorithms on the small maze, medium maze, large maze, open maze, empty maze, wall maze, and the loops maze. For each problem instance and each search algorithm, report the following in a table:

1. The solution and its path cost
2. Number of nodes expanded
3. Maximum tree depth searched
4. Maximum size of the frontier.
5. Display each solution by marking every maze square (or state) visited and the squares on the final path.
